# work-day-scheduler

Module 5 Challenge

## Description

Created Javascript to give functionality to a work-day scheduler. Added code so that values entered into scheduler persist, and linked javascript to CSS classes so that certain colors display depending on the past, present, or future tense of the entered item.
